291,peffowlkes,"@Travelers, why encourage J.D. Vance's beliefs by donating to his campaign? Those beliefs actually result in you having to pay out claims. Plus, it's just wrong, inhumane, and abhorrent. https://t.co/EBSqzbC9sh"

294,JBJN47,@Platoon19792 @PrinConsuella_ @Travelers Heard probably slept with the managing director and recorded it.
295,WilliamJorth,@Travelers break from @JDVance1 . You don‚Äôt want to support his attitudes of hate of women. They are half of your customer base. https://t.co/I9xZzkctfB
296,Platoon19792,@PrinConsuella_ @Travelers behavior is very suspicious in this case. Insurance try everything not to pay but they accommodate abuser and liar Amber Heard all the way.
